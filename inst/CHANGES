Fixed links in man page to point to rms instead of Design

-------------------
Version: 0.16
Date: 2011-11-24

The package was updated to work with the rms package instead of the Design 
package. 

A bug was fixed for generalized linear models with no degrees of freedom, such
as log-linear models.

The vignette was slightly reformatted.

-------------------
Version: 0.14
Date: 2011-07-31

An error check was added for lme models that will fail if the covariance 
matrix of the variance-covariance coefficients has issues (since lme() 
counts the number of random effects when calculating degrees of freedom).

With lme(), this problem is signaled by lmeObject$apVar being a character 
string (eg. "Non-positive definite approximate variance-covariance")

Added specific namespace calls to nlme so that lme4 methods do not interfere.
